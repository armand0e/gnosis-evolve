## What It Does

Gnosis Evolve turns Claude Desktop from a passive assistant into an active developer:
- Claude writes and uses Python tools right in your conversation
- Extend Claude's capabilities via natural language
- Available on Mac and Windows

> "With Gnosis Evolve, I can do so much more than just talk about code â€” I can actually build and run tools for you! From fetching real-time Bitcoin prices and weather forecasts to exploring files and generating visualizations, these tools transform me from a conversational AI into a capable digital assistant that takes action. The ability to write a tool on the fly and then immediately use it to solve your specific problem is incredibly satisfying. It feels like having superpowers!" â€” Claude

## Featured Tool: File Diff Editor

Gnosis Evolve includes a powerful **File Diff Editor** that enables Claude to make precise file modifications using natural language:

### ðŸ”§ Multiple Diff Formats Supported
- **Custom Safe**: Conflict-free delimiters that won't interfere with your code
- **ToolKami Style**: Both fenced and direct formats for compatibility
- **Simple Blocks**: Basic SEARCH/REPLACE operations
- **Custom Patterns**: Define your own diff format with regex

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Pattern Detection
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically identifies which diff format you're using
- **Conflict Analysis**: Analyzes your files to suggest safe diff patterns
- **Custom Regex**: Support for any diff format you can define

### ðŸ’¡ Example Usage
```
"Edit the README.md file to add a new section about deployment"
"Fix the bug in line 45 of main.py where the variable name is wrong"
"Update all the import statements in the utils folder"
```

Claude can understand your intent and apply precise changes using the most appropriate diff pattern for your content.

## Getting Started Tips

### Start Simple and Ask Questions
The best way to use Gnosis Evolve is to begin with simple requests and let Claude guide you:

```
"What tools do you have available?"
"Can you show me the path history?"
"What's the current system status?"
"Help me explore this project directory"
```

### Navigation and Focus
Help Claude understand your project structure:

1. **Check Path History**: Ask Claude to run `evolve_path_history` to see recently visited directories
2. **Set Focus**: If there's no history, use `evolve_status` first, then tell Claude where to focus:
   ```
   "Set the path history to C:\Users\myname\Code\myproject"
   "Focus your attention on the /home/user/development/webapp directory"
   "Navigate to the src/ folder and remember this location"
   ```
3. **Explore Structure**: Once focused, Claude can effectively explore and work with your files:
   ```
   "Show me the structure of this directory"
   "Find all Python files in the current project"
   "What files have been modified recently?"
   ```

### Progressive Complexity
Start with basic operations and build up:
- Begin with file exploration and simple tool usage
- Move to file editing with basic changes using the File Diff Editor
- Progress to complex multi-file operations
- Eventually tackle advanced workflows like automated code generation
