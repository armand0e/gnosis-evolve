# file_diff_writer.py Evolution Summary

## Changes Made (Version 0.1.2)

### Problem Identified
The original `file_diff_writer.py` tool was missing single-line fuzzy matching functionality that was present in `toolkami_enhanced_diff.py`. This meant it couldn't handle partial matches within single lines, such as:
- Missing punctuation (e.g., searching for "Line 6: This is the last line" to match "Line 6: This is the last line.")
- Substring matches (e.g., searching for "Line 6: This line mentions fuzzy" to match "Line 6: This line mentions fuzzy matching algorithms.")

### Solution Implemented
Added a new Strategy 4 to the `find_fuzzy_matches` function:
- **Single-line fuzzy matching** with relaxed threshold
- Uses `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to calculate similarity between search line and each content line
- Applies a more relaxed threshold: `max(0.6, similarity_threshold - 0.2)`
- Finds the best matching line when no exact or normalized matches are found

### Code Changes
1. Updated `find_fuzzy_matches` function to include single-line fuzzy matching strategy
2. Added "single_line" to the default methods list
3. Updated `apply_diff_edit` to include "single_line" in methods when `allow_partial_matches` is True
4. Incremented version to 0.1.2

### Testing Results
Successfully tested the following scenarios:
1. **Missing punctuation**: "Line 7: This is the last line" matched "Line 7: This is the last line." with similarity 0.98
2. **Partial line match**: "Line 6: This line mentions fuzzy" matched "Line 6: This line mentions fuzzy matching algorithms." with similarity 0.75

### Benefits
- More flexible matching for user-friendly diff editing
- Better handling of common typos and partial searches
- Maintains backward compatibility while adding new functionality
- Aligns with the capabilities users expect from "advanced fuzzy matching"

## Recommendation
The updated `file_diff_writer.py` tool now provides the fuzzy matching capabilities that were missing, making it more robust and user-friendly for real-world text editing scenarios.
