# Security Considerations for Gnosis: Evolve

This document outlines the security implications of using Gnosis: Evolve and provides recommendations for safe usage.

## Understanding the Security Model

Gnosis: Evolve gives Claude Desktop the ability to create and execute Python code on your local machine. While this provides powerful capabilities, it also introduces certain security considerations that users should be aware of:

### 1. Code Execution Permissions

Any code executed through Gnosis: Evolve runs with the same system permissions as the user who launched Claude Desktop. This means:

- The code has access to all files and directories that your user account can access
- It can make network connections, access the internet, and communicate with other services
- It can read, write, and modify files according to your user permissions
- It can potentially access sensitive information stored on your system

### 2. Trust Model

Gnosis: Evolve operates on a trust model where:

- Claude aims to generate safe, helpful code that performs the requested task
- Python code is executed in a standard Python interpreter without sandboxing
- The user is ultimately responsible for reviewing code before allowing it to run

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For Casual Users

1. **Use a Standard User Account**: Avoid running Claude Desktop with administrator/root privileges.

2. **Be Specific in Requests**: When asking Claude to create a tool, be clear about what you want it to do and what data it should access.

3. **Review Generated Code**: For sensitive operations, ask Claude to explain the code before running it.

4. **Start Simple**: Begin with simple, low-risk tools like calculators or text processors before moving to tools that access sensitive data or external services.

5. **Update Regularly**: Keep your operating system, security software, and Python installation up to date.

### For Professional or High-Security Environments

1. **Dedicated User Account**: Create a separate, restricted user account specifically for running Gnosis: Evolve.

2. **Virtualization**: Consider running Claude Desktop in a virtual machine or container for additional isolation.

3. **Network Controls**: Use firewall rules to restrict which network resources Claude-generated code can access.

4. **File System Isolation**: Limit access to only specific directories that contain non-sensitive data.

5. **Code Review Process**: Implement a formal review process for all tools before they are used in a production environment.

6. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging to track all actions performed by Gnosis: Evolve tools.

## Specific Security Measures

### Windows Security Measures

1. **Windows Sandbox**: Consider running Claude Desktop in Windows Sandbox for ephemeral, isolated execution.

2. **AppLocker Policies**: In enterprise environments, use AppLocker to control which applications and scripts can run.

3. **Windows Defender Application Control**: Use WDAC policies to restrict application execution.

### macOS Security Measures

1. **Gatekeeper**: Ensure Gatekeeper is enabled to verify apps before running them.

2. **FileVault**: Enable disk encryption to protect sensitive data.

3. **App Sandbox**: Consider using tools like Apparency to check if apps respect sandboxing.

### Python-Specific Security Measures

1. **Virtual Environments**: Run Gnosis: Evolve tools in a dedicated Python virtual environment with only necessary packages installed.

2. **Restricted Subprocess Usage**: Be cautious of tools that use Python's subprocess module, as this can execute arbitrary system commands.

3. **Package Auditing**: Regularly audit installed Python packages for vulnerabilities.

## Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident related to Gnosis: Evolve:

1. Immediately terminate Claude Desktop
2. Disconnect the affected system from the network if possible
3. Examine logs to determine what actions were taken
4. Report the incident to your security team or IT support
5. Report the issue to the Gnosis: Evolve maintainers

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Gnosis: Evolve, please report it responsibly by contacting the maintainers directly rather than creating a public issue.
